This chapter explains the experimental data using the methods introduced in the previous chapter. For the X-ray pump-- X-ray probe study, data on heterogeneous clusters, i.e. helium droplets doped with xenon, have been taken at different time delays $\Delta t$. To complement the data, pristine data, i.e. helium droplets and xenon droplets individually, have been recorded at different time delays $\Delta t$ and the static case.\\

The chapter is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:xenon-data} discusses the pristine xenon data and section \ref{sec:helium-data} covers the pristine helium data. Section \ref{sec:helium-xenon-data} shows the proof of principle that tampered layers mitigate radiation damage effects of an enclosed aerosol sample object.

Single xenon diffraction images have been selected using the hitfinder combination explained in section \ref{sec:hitfinding}. In brief, only hits that had high xenon charge states were selected. From this subset, another filter was applied that selected images with high signal on the pnCCD detector. Using these filters, a typical run of length 20 mins, i.e. $\sim 144,000$ images, was reduced to a subset of 30 - 60 images per run. These 30 - 60 images acceptable for reconstructions and it allows us the estimation that $0.02\% - 0.04\%$ of all imaged xenon cluster had good parameter for analysis. However, the hitrate in the live experiment was situated at $5\%-20\%$, which includes double or multi cluster hits and weakly scattering hits.\\
A 1D projection of selected diffraction pattern at time delays $\Delta t= \{0, 60, 120, 250, 400, 800\}$ fs can be found in figure \ref{fig:Xe-only-diff-pattern}. Per delay step $\Delta t$, the figure shows: A red line, which is the scattering as per equation \eqref{eq:scattering from sphere} fitted onto the low-$\vec{Q}$ signal of the zeroth diffraction scattering order. The black data points are projected from the rear pnCCD. The blue data points are projected from the front pnCCD. As the time delay $\Delta t$ between pump and probe pulse increases, the large-$\vec{Q}$ scattering signal decreases. This effect is similar to recent studies \citep{Gorkhover-2016-NatPho} performed on xenon cluster using an IR-pump and X-ray probe setup. It appears that the TBD\\

\end{figure}
The analysis of diffraction pattern also reveals a large scale characterization of the sample size. The size of several hundred single xenon cluster has been determined in figure \ref{fig:size-distributions}. Equation \eqref{eq:scattering from sphere} has be abused to semi-automate the size determination process, enabling high-throughput analytics. The size useful for a characterization of the source. The analysis shows that the size distribution follows a log-normal distribution PARAMETER. If the delay $\Delta t$ is increased, the mean of the log-normal distribution increases FROM TO. TBD

\end{figure}
The total number of scatterers, i.e. electrons that interact with LCLS, can be deducted from the diffraction patterns as well. As described in the theory section \ref{sec:saxs}, when
\begin{equation}
I\left(\vec{Q}\rightarrow 0\right)\propto N_{e}^{2},
\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
with the scattered intensity $I$ as a function of the scattering vector $\vec{Q}$ and number of electrons that contribute to the scattering process $N_{e}$. Figure \ref{fig:number-of-scatterer} shows the average fitting parameter $A$, which has been multiplied to equation \eqref{eq:scattering from sphere} to scale the intensity of the scattered curve, as a function of the time delay $\Delta t$ between the X-ray pump -- X-ray probe beam (blue dots) and several linear fits to simplify the interpretation (red lines). The averages were obtained in the analysis of about $\sim 15-30$ single xenon cluster diffraction pattern per delay step. The data show that the amount of electrons in the scattering system decreases only little. However, after a time delay of $\Delta t=400$ fs, the amount of scattering electrons decreases on average by $\sim 26 \%$. This could mean that the Coulomb trapping of the expanding nanoplasma is sufficient up to this delay step. At the delay step $\Delta t =800$ fs, the expansion of the cluster is in full process, thus the Coulomb potential decreases while the multistep ionization further energizes the system. Eventually, electrons overcome the Coulomb potential and dissipate the interaction region such that they do not contribute to the scattering anymore.

\subsection{Reconstructions of xenon cluster single shot images}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%- Present Xe - cluster reconstructions\\
%- Show 1D reconstructions and 'damage process'

\end{figure}
1D reconstructions of single xenon cluster were obtained as described in section \ref{sec:1d-proj-and-phase-reconstruction}. Figure \ref{fig:Xe-reconstructions} shows 1D reconstructions of the projected electron density from single xenon cluster at time delays $\Delta t=\{0, 400, 800\}$ fs between the X-ray pump and X-ray probe beam. The density curves are normalized to clearly indicate an accelerated expansion of the outer atomic layers of the cluster. In this selection of hits, the cluster radii expand by $\sim 20\%$ over a time delay of $\Delta t=800 fs$, which is a substantial structural change. To make these events COMPARABLE INCLUDE DIFFRACTION PATTERNS. ELECTRON TEMPERATURE\\
For the sake of completeness, the recovered phase information and diffraction pattern are shown in FIGURE TBD.\\

	\label{fig:Xe-2D-reconstructions}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:Xe-2D-reconstructions} shows 2D reconstructions of single xenon cluster at $\Delta t = 0$ fs (left) and $\Delta t=800$ fs (right). The cluster are appear generally spherical and of similar size. The signal-to-noise ratio is visibly better at $\Delta t=0$ fs than $\Delta t=800$ fs. This is due to the described loss of electrons, i.e. signal, in figure \ref{fig:number-of-scatterer}. Due to the normalization, the center of the projected electron density appears more dense, however, the loss of electrons in the center of the cluster flats out the overall density profile making the center of the normalized electron density appear more dense. The reconstruction at $\Delta t=800$ fs shows also a ringing around the actual cluster, which is likely an artifact of the spherical support structure and low signal-to-noise ratio and not an electron ring/hull around the cluster.

%- Xe iToF dynamics\\

\end{figure}
Ion time of flight traces of atomic xenon at different time delays $\Delta t = \{0, 120, 250, 400, 800\}$ fs is shown in figure \ref{fig:TOF-atomic-xenon} and X-ray pump only data. To create an atomic gas-jet, the experimental parameter at the source were changed to the reservoir pressure being $XXX$ bar and the timing was changed FROM TO. The time of flight data show a resonance type of behavior of the atomic xenon high charge states with a peak of high-charge state yield at $\Delta t = 250$ fs. The initial increase can be explained with a X-ray induced transparency increase (XITI) \citep{Schorb-2012-PRL} behavior of the atoms. The multistep ionization pathways after a time delay $\Delta t = 250$ fs appear less favorable for the creation of atomic high charge states.
