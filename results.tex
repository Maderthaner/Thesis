\chapter{Results and discussion}\label{ch:results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%- Introduction of what we are looking for, reminder of hypothesis
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This chapter explains the experimental data using the methods introduced in the previous chapter. For the X-ray pump-- X-ray probe study, data on heterogeneous clusters, i.e. helium droplets doped with xenon, have been taken at different time delays $\Delta t$. To complement the data, pristine data, i.e. helium droplets and xenon droplets individually, have been recorded at different time delays $\Delta t$ and the static case.\\
The chapter is organized as follows. Section \ref{sec:xenon-data} discusses the pristine xenon data and section \ref{sec:helium-data} covers the pristine helium data. Section \ref{sec:helium-xenon-data} shows the proof of principle that tampered layers mitigate radiation damage effects of an enclosed aerosol sample object.

\section{Conclusion of the X-ray pump -- X-ray probe study}
- Conclusion where the results are compared to each other\\
- This experiment shows that heterogeneous clusters, as in tampered layers, do inhibit radiation damage of the sample target while the sacrificial layer undergoes a rapid nanoplasma transition.
