\section*{Abstract}\label{ch:abstract}
With the advent of X-ray free electron laser, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), structural studies on non-repetitive and non-reproducible nanoparticles, such as single bio-molecules appear imminent. A key challenge to increasing the resolution of single particle imaging is radiation damage. Only a sound understanding of the underlying damage processes, such as the nanoplasma expansion, can overcome this challenge and will lead to higher spatial resolutions. Further, sacrificial layers have been proposed to slow the nanoplasma expansion.\\[0.4\baselineskip]

This thesis investigates nanoplasma formation and expansion in superfluid He-, bulk Xe- and heterogeneous HeXe-clusters, whereby HeXe-clusters are testbed nanoparticles for sacrificial layers. The clusters are generated through a supersonic gas expansion into a vacuum and investigated using an ultrafast X-ray pump--X-ray probe technique from the LCLS. A first X-ray pulse triggers the nanoplasma evolution at intensities of \SI{\sim 2e16}{\watt\per\square\centi\meter}, and a second X-ray probe-pulse, with power densities of \SI{\sim 2e17}{\watt\per\square\centi\meter}, creates diffraction images of the nanoplasma at a later time, $\Delta t$. $\Delta t$ is varied between \SIrange{0}{800}{\femto\second} and furthermore ion-spectra are captured via time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectroscopy. The experiment was performed at the AMO instrument using the LAMP end-station at LCLS. The LAMP end-station was partly designed, built, and operated as part of this thesis work.\\[0.4\baselineskip]

The study reveals single-shot diffraction images and TOF spectra of Xe-, He- and HeXe-clusters with unprecedented resolution, for example, the reconstruction of a \SI{\sim 25}{\nano\meter} radius Xe-cluster with \SI{\sim 6}{\nano\meter} resolution is shown. The diffraction images and corresponding reconstructions show the nanoplasma formation and expansion of those clusters. An analysis of several hundred diffraction images suggests that the initial Xe-cluster radius increases by \SI{\sim20}{\percent} over \SI{800}{\femto\second}. Therefore, the expansion-speed is \SI{\sim 15250}{\meter\per\second}, and the electron temperature is \SI{\sim125}{\electronvolt}. Reconstructions and 2D computer models of few-hundred nanometer radius HeXe-clusters indicate that they agglomerate similar to a plum-pudding model, as Xe-atoms condense to multiple small clusters within the He-droplet. TOF spectra strongly imply that the Xe-clusters transfer kinetic energy to the sacrificial layer and that the He-layer supplies electrons to the ionized Xe-clusters. Diffraction images and 2D computer models of HeXe-clusters show that encapsulated Xe-clusters do not exhibit detectable damage in the initial \SI{800}{\femto\second}, while the He-layer undergoes an expansion. As a measure of the effectiveness of the sacrificial layer, the radiation damage of pristine He- and Xe-clusters, as well as HeXe-clusters are compared to each other.
