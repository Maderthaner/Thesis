The electron bunches emit radiation with a wavelength depending on $K_{i}$. A time delay $\Delta t$ between pulses is introduced using a magnetic chicane.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {\relax 2.4}{\ignorespaces Schematic setup of the two bunch, two color pump--probe setup at LCLS. Two laser pulses shot at a cathode create two electron bunches with a delay $\Delta t$ on the picosecond timescale. Two magnetic chicanes compress the bunches such that a delay $\Delta t$ on the up to the ten femtosecond timescale is achieved. Both pulses go through one undulator section and the SASE lasing process is saturated. The relative color separation is on the order of $1\%$.}}{14}{figure.2.4}
