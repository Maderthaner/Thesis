\chapter{Experimental Setup}\label{ch:exp_setup}
%- Start by introducing LCLS\\
%- Introduction to the AMO instrument at LCLS\\
%- Introduction to the LAMP chamber\\
%- Give example experiments to each point
%\section{The X-ray free electron laser LCLS}
%- Describe LCLS more specifically
%\subsection{LCLS pump probe setup}
%- Specifics to our / LCLSs pump probe setup
\section{The atomic, molecular and optcal physics instrument at LCLS}
- Specifics to AMO\\
- For example focus studies and KBOs\\
- Use JSR and previous AMO articles
\section{The LAMP end-station at AMO}
- Specifics to the LAMP setup\\
- Use Journal of Synch. Radiation LAMP paper\\
- I think this can be a longer subsection since a lot of my work went into this.
\section{The large area pn-CCD detectors}\label{sec:pnCCD}
- Reuse our work on the LAMp-pnCCD paper\\
- I think this should be a longer chapter since a lot of my work has gone into this.
\section{Time of flight mass-spectrometer}
- fundamental aspects to the TOF detector\\
- I'm hoping on some specific drawings from Timur / LCLS and SIMION simulations from Timur here.
\section{Sample delivery}
%\subsection{Xe - cluster}
%- I can probably recycle the usual here
%\subsection{He - cluster}
%- Experimental setup\\
%- Info from Andrey probably needed
