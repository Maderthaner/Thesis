The experiment described in the present thesis has been performed using the LAMP end-station in the Atomic, Molecular and Optical (AMO) Physics instrument of the Linac Coherent Light Source, which is located at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. SLAC is funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and operated by Stanford University. SLAC was founded in 1962 as Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The accelerator was mainly used for high-energy physics experiments and resulted in three Nobel Prizes in Physics \citep{Richter-PRL-1974,Taylor-SLAC-1967,Perl-PRL-1975} and many other accomplishments \citep{KELLEHER-1990-cell,Emma-2010-NatPho}. SLAC's research topics broadened in the 70's and with the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Project, SLAC became an X-ray user facility in 1974. The synchrotron source was modernized and is now known as the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). The linear accelerator has been repurposed to function as the world's first hard X-ray free electron laser and it is now known as the LCLS. The LCLS began operations in April 2009 \citep{Emma-2010-NatPho} and the AMO instrument started user operations in October 2009 \citep{Bostedt-2013-JPB}. AMO began operations using the High-Field Physics (HFP) and CFEL\footnote{Acronym for the Center for Free Electron Laser Science on the DESY campus in Hamburg, Germany.}-ASG\footnote{Short for the Advanced Study Group of the Max Planck Society in Hamburg, Germany.} Multi Purpuse (CAMP) end-station, however, the so-called ``LAMP'' end-station was commissioned in September 2013 and has been in use at AMO since then. The experiment described in this thesis was performed in January 2014\footnote{Experimental identifier at SLAC: \textsc{amoa1214}} in the LAMP end-station of the AMO instrument.\\[1\baselineskip]

The AMO instrument is located closest to the undulators of the LCLS at hutch 1. It is designed for soft X-ray photons in the energy range from 280 eV - 2000 eV \citep{Ferguson-2015-JSR,Bozek-2009-EPJST}, where the beam divergence is a limiting factor for lower energies and the B4C-coating on some mirrors leads to absorption above 2000 eV. After the X-ray pulse generation in the undulators of the LCLS, the beam is transported through vacuum to the Front End Enclosure (FEE) \citep{Moeller-2011-NIMPR}, where the electron beam is deflected using magnets and subsequently dumped in a beam stop such that only X-rays continue. Optionally, the XTCAV \citep{Behrens-2014-NatCom} can be used to give insight into the kinetic energy and pulse duration of the electron beam. In the FEE, the X-rays can be attenuated with either a gas or a solid attenuation scheme. An X-ray pulse energy monitor, often referred to as a gas detector, measures the pulse energy of a single shot before and after the attenuation \citep{Hau-Riege-2010-PRL-2}. Eventually, the X-ray beam is deflected through a mirror system into the desired hutch. To direct the beam to the AMO hutch, the soft X-ray offset mirrors (SOMS) are used. SOMS are a set of three mirrors, where the first two are shared with hutch 2, which is named the Soft X-ray (SXR) instrument \citep{Schlotter-2012-RSI,Soufli-2012-AppOpt,Dakovski-2015-JSR} and the third one is dedicated to the AMO instrument.

The indicated distances below the schematic items are in meters from the interaction region. As the X-ray beam enters the instrument, it can be visualized on a YAG crystal diagnostics (D). A set of 2 slits (S) cuts the beam in the vertical and horizontal to reduce straylight from the Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) optics. The differential pumping section of the LAMP end-station houses another YAG crystal diagnostics (D) and an option couple in an optical laser (L-IN) on-axis with the X-rays. The front and back pnCCD (F/B-pnCCD) are located downstream of the IR with further beam viewing options (D). From \citep{Ferguson-2015-JSR}.}

The AMO instrument is versatile in its configuration and three different end-stations have been used so far. In historic order, one, the HFP end-station \citep{Bozek-2009-EPJST,Bostedt-2013-JPB}, two, CAMP end-station \citep{Strueder-2010-NIMPA}, and three, the LAMP end-station \citep{Ferguson-2015-JSR,Bucher-2016-Unpublished}. As the experiment described in the present work has been performed with the LAMP end-station, we shall focus on that AMO-configuration from here on.\\[1\baselineskip]
%
A schematic overview of the AMO beamline instrumentation in the LAMP configuration can be found in Figure \ref{fig:beam_layout}. As the X-ray beam travels from the FEE to the AMO beamline, it can be projected onto a YAG crystal diagnostic viewer (D). Here the shape and position of the beam can be well determined as it is several meters downstream of the SOMS such that a difference of the SOMS angle and position can be determined with sub-millimeter precision. The projection also reveals the alignment of the beam with respect to several differential pumping apertures that are located in the FEE and the beam should be centered to those apertures \citep{Turner-2016-PC}. In the described experiment, the X-ray beam became unstable and the beam's pointing became erratic. The most upstream YAG crystal of the AMO instrument was able to detect this jitter such that the accelerator could be tuned to correct the erratic pointing. However, a beamline alignment laser (typical HeNe-laser with low beam divergence) can be coupled into the beamline shortly downstream of the YAG screen\footnote{Not shown in  Figure \ref{fig:beam_layout}} such that it co-propagates with the X-rays. Beamline alignment lasers are invaluable tools to pre-align a system before X-rays are employed. For the described experiment, it was necessary to align the particle jet of the pristine Xe-cluster and the particle jet of the HeXe-cluster to be perpendicular to the X-ray beam (see \ref{fig:Overview-Jetalignment}). In order to perform this alignment, a beamline alignment laser that co-propagates with the X-rays was useful, if not required. The X-ray beam then travels through a set of four blades (S) that can be moved independently to cut into the beam to reduce noise effects on the detectors, especially originating from the the Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB-)optics \citep{Kirkpatrick-1948-JOSA}. In collaboration with the Single-Particle Initiative \citep{Aquila-2015-StrucDyn}, it was investigated how the blades reduce unwanted scattering. It was found that the blades should not cut into the main intensity profile of the beam, but rather conservatively cut into the halo of the beam \citep{SPI-2015-unpublished}. This sufficiently reduced straylight but did not reduce the peak intensity of the X-ray pulse (compare green and blue curve in Figure \ref{fig:Focus-z-scan}).

The KB-optics focus the X-ray beam into the interaction region. The optics consist of two 400 mm long silicon (Si) substrates that are coated with boron carbide (B4C). They reflect the X-rays in grazing incidence at 13.85 mrad and are sometimes called KB mirrors. One mirror reflects the beam in the horizontal and the other reflects the beam in the vertical. As the mirrors are located at different positions in the horizontal and vertical, they are designed to have a focal length of 1600 mm in the horizontal and 1100 mm in the vertical. Additionally, the mirrors can be bent to change their focusing position along the Z-axis\footnote{The LCLS uses a right-handed coordinate system, where the index finger (Y-axis) points up and the middle finger (Z-axis) points parallel to the X-ray beam.} and the optimal focus can be found and characterized through 1) the study of time-of-flight (TOF)\index{time-of-flight} mass-spectroscopy \citep{Bucher-2016-Unpublished} and 2) imprint analysis\index{imprint} \citep{Hajkova-2011-SPIE,Chalupsky-2011-NIMPR}. A study of the X-ray focus is necessary to achieve the smallest focus, thus increasing the fluence at the sample interaction region.
% which is desired in coherent diffractive imaging as thus more photons scatter from the sample and, ideally, to understand the coherent wavefront that creates an image of the particle better.

\subsection{Focus characterization using a TOF spectrometer}
%
The left panel in Figure \ref{fig:Focus-z-scan} shows a focus characterization along the Z-axis using a TOF spectrometer. The fractional neon ion yield per charge state is summed and plotted as a function of Z-position. A 2 mm region centering around the focal plane at $\text{Z}=0$ mm was located, where the beam was suitable for the experiment. The right panel of Figure \ref{fig:Focus-z-scan} compares the fractional neon ion yield at the optimal focus position from November 2013 \citep{Bucher-2016-Unpublished} to October 2009 \citep{Doumy-2011-PRL}. The comparison reveals that high-charge states of neon, for example, $Ne^{8+}$ and $Ne^{9+}$, are less frequent. We attribute this to deteriorated beamline optics.\\

\subsection{Focus characterization via imprint study}
%
The panels a) to d) in Figure \ref{fig:imprint-study} show images from an optical microscope of the result of a LCLS X-ray pulse at 1600 eV interacting with a lead tungstate ($\text{PbWO}_{4}$)\index{lead tungstate} sample at different transmission values, $T$. We can describe the energy fluence, E(R), as
\begin{equation}
E(R) = E_{0} e^{\frac{-R^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}},
\end{equation}
with the radial coordinate $R$, a characteristic radius $\sigma$, and the peak fluence $E_{0}$. Typically, $\sigma$ stays a constant beam parameter, but different peak fluences change the crater-area in the sample, e.g., more peak fluence usually increases the crater-area as more of the $\text{PbWO}_{4}$ surface is irradiated with power densities above the damage threshold. We can measure the peak fluence, $E_{0}$, through to the pulse energy, $E_{p}$, which is measured with the gas detector. Let us explicitly note the proportional depedency, $E_{p}\propto E_{0}$. Now, we can express the peak fluence more conveniently in terms of the pressure, $p$, in the gas attenuator
\begin{equation}
\log(E_{0}) = \log(E_{\text{in}})+\log(T)= -p \cdot c + \text{const.},
\label{eq:gaussian-beam-imprint}
\end{equation}
with the peak fluence into the gas attenuator $E_{in}$ and the transmission $T$. In the gas attenuator, the transmission is $T=e^{-p \cdot c}$ and a constant $c$. The constant $c$ can be derived from \citep{Henke-1993-ADNDT}. For the LCLS attenuator filled with nitrogen gas (N2) over its 410 cm length at 1600 eV photon energy, $c\approx 0.5611415 \text{ Torr}^{-1}$. We can further approximate the crater surface area using a circle. The area then is $\pi r_{0}^{2}$, with the crater radius $r_{0}$. As shown in \citep{Liu-1982-OptLett}, $r_{0}^{2}=2\sigma^{2}log(\frac{E_{0}^{2}}{E_{0}^{1}})$, with $E_{0}^{1/2}$ being the peak fluence at two different attenuation levels. Thus, the slope of a linear fit between the two points $E_{0}^{1/2}$ is $2 \pi \sigma^{2}$. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is $\text{FWHM}=2\sqrt{2 ln(2)}\sigma$. Figure \ref{fig:imprint-study} right shows the crater-area as a function of $-log(T)= p \cdot c$ (Liu's plot) and is fitted with two linear fits. The data indicates non-linearities that come from a super-Gaussian beam-profile \citep{Chalupsky-2010-OE,Chalupsky-2013-OE}. In this data set, using the slope of the linear fit at smaller transmissions, a $\text{FWHM}\approx \SI{3.4}{\micro\meter}$ is determined.\\[1\baselineskip]
%
However, for the described experiment in this thesis, the X-ray beam focal size was determined to be $\text{FWHM}\approx \SI{1.5}{\micro\meter}$, with an effective area of $\SI{5}{\micro\meter\squared}$ \citep{Bucher-2016-Unpublished}. The LCLS beam parameters are summarized in Table \ref{tab:beam-params}. The pulse duration was determined through analysis of the electron beam and the delay, $\Delta$t, precision is estimated from geometric considerations of the delay chicane (see also Section \ref{sec:novel-pump--probe-tech}).

	\caption[Overview of the AMO instrument in the LAMP end-station configuration.]{Overview of the AMO instrument in the LAMP end-station configuration. From left to right, the beam propagates through the Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) optics, the differential pumping (DP) section, the interaction chamber (C1), the front pnCCD chamber (C2-1), the rear pnCCD chamber (C2-2) and finally the diagnostics stand (DIA). The xenon jet is installed including the manipulator that holds the Parker valve, the Xe source chamber and the Xe skimmmer chamber. The helium jet is not included in this drawing but mounted perpendicular to the Xe jet and the vacuum pumps have not been installed as shown here. For scale, the large, open conflat flanges on the C1 chamber are 12 inch.}
	\label{fig:LAMP-overview}
\end{figure}
Still following the beamline layout in Figure \ref{fig:beam_layout}, the X-ray beam enters the LAMP end-station after the KB mirrors (see also the overview in Figure \ref{fig:LAMP-overview}). LAMP begins with a differential pumping (DP) section that separates the interaction (C1) and detector chambers (C2-1, C2-2) from the KB optics and other upstream beamline instrumentation. The differential pumping section consists of two small chambers that are pumped via turbo-molecular pumps and are connected to the LAMP chamber system via 5 mm, 8 mm, or 10 mm diameter differential pumping apertures (indicated in Figure \ref{fig:c1-ccd-spec}). The differential pumping stage is able to maintain up to 4 orders of magnitude pressure difference, for example, the pressure in the C1 vacuum chamber, $p_{\text{C1}}$, may rise to $p_{\text{C1}}=\SI{e-6}{\bar}$ as the sample injection starts and the pressure in the KB-optics vacuum tank, $p_{\text{KB}}$, is maintained at $p_{\text{KB}}=\SI{e-10}{\bar}$ due to the differential pumping section. The first differential pumping stage holds a YAG crystal to examine the X-ray beam after the KB optics. The second stage holds a reomvable laser in-coupling mirror to overlap X-rays with an optical laser or an aperture to prevent scattering from the differential pumping apertures and upstream elements.\\[1\baselineskip]
\begin{figure}

	\caption{Inside view of the C1 chamber showcasing the interaction region.}
	\label{fig:c1-ccd-spec}
\end{figure}
The beam then travels into the C1 chamber that encloses the interaction region. Before reaching the sample interaction region, the beam is cut by apertures (see Figure \ref{fig:c1-ccd-spec}). The apertures are mounted on encoded stages that are driven by piezoelectric actuators with absolute sub-micron movement precision. The aperture material is silicon nitride ($\text{Si}_{3}\text{N}_{4}$) with tapered-edge windows to allow the X-rays to traverse. The window-size can be either fit to the size of the X-ray beam diameter, which can be estimated using geometric optics, or by using one corner of the window on the first aperture stage and the opposite corner on the second stage. As part of this thesis work, an improved aperture system was designed using four aperture blades with tapered edges. These allow full control over the aperture from four directions, thus allowing short aperture alignment times and a more controled reduction of unwanted effects. For soft X-rays, it is important to note that the flat surface of the tapered aperture is facing the beam such that the tapered-edge is facing downstream. Otherwise unwanted reflections may occur. This aperture system was commissioned in 2015 for diffractive imaging experiments at the AMO instrument.\\[1\baselineskip]

	\caption[Rear and front pnCCD detector geometry in the LAMP instrument.]{Side view of the rear and front pnCCD detector inside LAMP. The interaction region (IR) is in the center of C1. The beam propagates along the Z-axis where the rear (top) pnCCD is placed $728.53$ mm away from the IR (original engineering distances). The half detector height is $38.3$ mm and results in a scattering angle of $\Theta = 4.26$°. With the gate-valve installed, the front pnCCDs are able to travel along the Z-axis from $370.9$ mm to $120.9$ mm downstream of the IR. The front pnCCDs position along the Y-axis is adjustable and they can detect photons up to $48.3$ mm from the beam axis. At maximum extension, the pnCCDs are able to detect photons up to a scattering angle of $\Theta=38.11$°.}
	\label{fig:pnCCD-dimensions}
\end{figure}
In the center of C1, where sample and X-rays interact, a time-of-flight spectrometer is located (see Figure \ref{fig:c1-ccd-spec}), which we will describe in the Section \ref{sec:TOF-spectrometer}. The beam then passes between the modules of the front pnCCD, which is mounted on a moveable stage. Another in-vacuum manifold allows the use of another YAG crystal (D), an optical filter and a B4C beam stop just before the rear pnCCD. Figure \ref{fig:pnCCD-dimensions} shows relevant engineering design distances of the pnCCD detectors inside the LAMP instrument. These distances are relevant for the digital combination of pnCCD-images in different planes, which we will discuss in Section \ref{sec:combination-of-images}. In the following, we consider the instrument to have the gate valve mounted and that the FEL focus position is in the center of the C1 chamber. The distance from the focus to the bottom-rear pnCCD detector module is $731.68$ mm and the top-rear pnCCD module is $3.15$ mm closer to the C-1 chamber\footnote{These design distances are offset by $\sim +\SI{5}{\milli\meter}$ along the Z-axis due to customization during the initial setup.}. As mentioned, the front pnCCD can be moved along the Z-axis. The distance from the front-bottom pnCCD module to the focus can be set between $117.75$ mm and $367.75$ mm. The front-top pnCCD module is again $3.15$ mm closer to the center of C1. The front detectors can also be moved along the Y-axis and the maximum extent is $48.3$ mm from the beam to the onset of the detector. The manufacturing size of the gate-valve along the Z-axis is $150.6$ mm. In the described experiment, the front pnCCD modules were in the most rear position.\\

\section{The large area pn-CCD detectors}\label{sec:pnCCD}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%- I think this should be a longer chapter since a lot of my work has gone into this.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Diffraction patterns are recorded with pnCCD\index{pnCCD} detectors in LAMP's C2-1 and C2-2 chambers. A pnCCD is a versatile device and has found usage in astronomy and material science. pnCCDs have been used previously at LCLS, namely in the CAMP instrument. At LCLS, these detectors are mostly used for coherent diffractive imaging applications, but have also spectroscopic capabilities. These are demonstrated in the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:pnCCD-histogram}. The pnCCDs are attractive photon area detectors because of the following four reasons. Reason one, their high quantum efficiency (QE) and good signal to noise ratio. Two, their read-out rate is very high -- up to $\SI{200}{\hertz}$ -- and enables us to use the full repetition rate of LCLS, which is $\SI{120}{\hertz}$. Three, their large, consecutive active areas cover wide scattering angles, and last, the detectors are almost defect free after applying widely-used pixel detector image corrections. These points are explained in detail in the following \citep{Bucher-2016-Unpublished}.\\[1\baselineskip]
%
\begin{figure}
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/pnCCD-detail.png}
    \caption[Geometry of a single pnCCD module.]{Geometry of a single pnCCD module with a detailed view of the beam conveying hole. A single module consists of $1024 \times 512$ pixel. Each pixel is $\SI{75}{\micro\meter}$, which results in an active area of $76.8 \times \SI{38.4}{\milli\meter\squared}$. The chip is surrounded by non-active edges, which are $1.15$ mm wide on beam facing edges. The hole reduces the active area on one module by $60\times 22$ pixels, or $4.5 \times 1.65$ mm and allows the beam to propagate through a $2.4 \times \SI{1.7}{\milli\meter\squared}$ hole.}
\label{fig:ccd-detail}
\end{figure}
Let us begin by describing the chip geometry. Each front or rear pnCCD detector is made out of two modules. Figure \ref{fig:ccd-detail} shows the layout of a single pnCCD module\index{pnCCD!module}. The chip consists of $512 \times 1024$ pixels. Each pixel has a size\index{pnCCD!pixel size} of $75 \times \SI{75}{\micro\meter\squared}$, so the area that the detector covers is $38.4 \times \SI{76.8}{\milli\meter\squared}$. To allow the FEL beam to travel through the instrument, each module has a rectangular region cut out. On a single module this area is $4.5 \times \SI{1.65}{\milli\meter\squared}$ and for the whole detector this ``hole'' has the dimensions $4.5 \times \sim\SI{4.5}{\milli\meter\squared}$. The size of this hole has been chosen to slightly oversize the diverging FEL beam at the rear pnCCD position, when the focus is in the middle of the C1 chamber. The borders of each module are insensitive to photons and are $1.10$ to $1.15$ mm thick. To minimize the overall detector area that is insensitive to photons, the two pnCCD\index{pnCCD} modules are mounted such that the non sensitive areas overlap. As a result of that, each top module is $3.15$ mm closer to the interaction region than each bottom module. The effective gap that is seen in the laboratory frame images between each top and bottom module measures $16$ pixels or $\sim 1.2$ mm.\\[1\baselineskip]
%
The pnCCD chip is read out with a custom CMOS multichannel Analog MultiplEXer (CAMEX)\index{pnCCD!CAMEX}. The CAMEX pre-amplifies the charges through a set of gain amplifiers and enables a parallel read-out of $128$ pixel rows simultaneously. Each CAMEX converts the signal to an analog output, enabling the read out of all pnCCD rows at once, thus allowing the high read-out speed of up to $200$ Hz. The analog signal is converted to a digital signal and the image information is stored by the LCLS Data Acquisition (DAQ)\index{pnCCD!Data Acquisition} in the LCLS psana\index{psana} network, where it is accessible for analysis.\\[1\baselineskip]

\label{tab:gain-modes}
\end{table}
The pnCCD can be operated in different gain modes\index{pnCCD!gain} to be more sensitive to photons in high gains or to have more dynamic range in lower gains. Table \ref{tab:gain-modes} shows data of gain setting and signal generation in arbitrary detector units (ADU). The following considerations are necessary when combining detectors of different gain settings or ADU generation. The different gain amplifications are applied through the CAMEX. Gain $\frac{1}{1}$ is the highest gain and $\frac{1}{256}$ is the lowest gain. As one steps from highest to lower gains, e.g., from $1$ to $\frac{1}{64}$, the ADU value creation per photon goes with that fraction in good approximation. Hence, going to lower gains reduces the signal-to-noise ratio but increases the dynamic range. Note, that the table shows typical operating values using $1$ keV photons and that the ADU value creation is dispersive. The thin and unstructured radiation entrance windows have a high quantum-efficiency from the infra-red (IR) to soft X-ray wavelength range. In order to avoid unwanted scattering, the photon entrance windows are located at the back of the detector, thus facing upstream of LCLS, and are coated with 50 nm aluminum to reduce their sensitivity from infra-red and optical light. This aluminum coating does attenuate the soft X-rays at AMO slightly but the detectors maintain a QE of $\sim \SI{90}{\percent}$. At AMO, it is thus possible to linearly extrapolate the generated ADU values to other photon energies, for example a 1.5k eV photon will generate approximately 1750 ADU in highest gain (compare Figure \ref{fig:pnCCD-histogram}). The in this thesis used 837 eV photons will approximately generate $\sim 1087$ eV. There is also an optical aluminum filter mounted from the front of the chip, thus facing downstream of LCLS, to drastically reduce wrongly directed scattering.

Two gas sources are used in order to create single rare-gas clusters. Single xenon and helium clusters are produced using the principle of the supersonic gas expansion into a vacuum that is described in Section \ref{sec:homogenous-cluster}. Helium clusters that are doped with xenon are produced through the pickup principle as described in Section \ref{sec:heterogeneous-cluster}. Given the time constraint of performing experiments at the LCLS, both sources are installed in one setup and operate independently, allowing quick sample changes. A schematic setup of the sample environment can be found in Figure \ref{fig:Overview-Jetalignment} and a list of used vacuum pumps can be found in Table \ref{tab:vacuum-table}.\\[1\baselineskip]

The AMO cluster source, which produces a single xenon cluster, consists of a Parker-Hannifin Series 99\footnote{Series 99 is at the time of writing not produced/advertised as a straight, in-line pulsed valve anymore.} - pulsed valve using a solenoid with a custom manufactured conical copper nozzle, two vacuum chambers to mount two skimmers, a third adjustable piezo-slit skimmer and several vacuum pumps. It is a well-characterized source that was used extensively in the past \citep{Ferguson-2016-SciAdv,Ferguson-2015-JSR,Gorkhover-2012-PRL,Gorkhover-2016-NatPho,Rupp-2014-JCP}. The pulsed solenoid valve (see Figure \ref{fig:parker-valve}) is controlled and operated by a Parker-Hannifin Iota One pulsed-valve driver. The valve driver applies a current to the solenoid, a magnetic cylinder actuates and the attached poppet opens and closes again after a set TTL signal from the driver. The valve's opening time is set to 1 ms and repetition rates of up to $30$ Hz can be set at a xenon reservoir pressure range of \SIrange{1}{20}{\bar}. The pulsed valve heats up substantially during operations and due to material deterioration and the vespel poppet is replaced every $\sim 60$ h of operating time, or as needed to prevent a leakage from the gas source. The nozzle has a $\SI{200}{\micro\meter}$ opening diameter and an opening half angle of \ang{4}. It is clamped to the Parker valve using an indium gasket to seal. Two skimmers with an opening of 1 mm diameter and an adjustable piezo-skimmer have been installed to define the gas jet. The piezo skimmer allows fine control over the slit opening formed by two razor blades. The blades can be closed by applying a voltage, $U$, from \SIrange{0}{8}{\volt}. At $U=\SI{8}{\volt}$, the cluster source operates in the single cluster regime. The background pressures in the respective source and skimmer chambers is handled through turbo-molecular pumps that are connected to roughing pumps (see Table \ref{tab:vacuum-table}). Ultimately, these chambers lower the gas pressure in the interaction region, $p_{\text{IR}}$, or C1 chamber to $p_{\text{IR}}\leq \SI{e-5}{\bar}$.\\[1\baselineskip]

Helium droplets are produced in a continuous free gas expansion using an electron microscope diaphragm as nozzle (Plano A0200P) that has a \SI{5}{\micro\meter} orifice and an orifice channel length of $\sim\SI{2}{\micro\meter}$ \citep{Gomez-2011-JCP}. The nozzle is cooled to cryogenic temperatures $\text{T}= 5.8$ K using a Sumitomo cold-head. The particle beam is defined by a first 0.5 mm and a second 1 mm diameter skimmer. As explained above, a third piezo-skimmer allows the definition the gas jet to single helium droplets. A doping unit is installed in the skimmer chamber of the helium source. The doping unit is a separate, smaller chamber in the skimmer chamber, where He-clusters can traverse through. The gas cell allows locally increasing the pressure of the cell with gaseous xenon to $\leq \SI{3e-6}{\bar}$. The pressure is manually controlled using a leak valve. Since the gas load is confined in the doping unit, the vacuum system is not overloaded. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:pickupPrinciple}, the partial helium pressure is determined with a residual gas analyzer (RGA) in the source chamber of the AMO cluster source, which can then be used to determine the depletion of the helium cluster through the pickup of xenon atoms. A thorough alignment of the sources is necessary to overlap the particle beams such they traverse through all skimmers.%A summary of the alignment with a telescope and alignment laser is condensed in appendix \ref{sec:source-alignment}.

	\caption{Schematic of LCLS EVR timing system.}
	\label{fig:LCLS-EVR-timing}
\end{figure}
Pulsed gas jets such as the one using the Parker solenoid valve require an electric trigger to open the valve. At LCLS, an event generator sends a fiducial, i.e., a clock signal with 360 Hz, and several event codes, e.g., at 120 Hz, to an event receiver (EVR) over a fiber network with a 10 ps precision \citep{Krejcik-2007-DIPAC}. The EVR processes these signals and systems in need of an electric trigger can be connected to the EVR to receive a specific one. The triggers coming from the EVR are based on specific event codes (ECs), for example, EC 40 operates at 120 Hz and may be delayed with respect to the EC. Figure \ref{fig:LCLS-EVR-timing} schematically illustrates the timing system. Following the figure, the process starts with a fiducial, an EC is delayed by time of event code x (TECx) and after a certain time of the fiducial a LCLS pulse arrives. At the AMO instrument, this time is $t_{\text{AMO}}\approx 893000$ ns\footnote{Times are in nanoseconds (ns) and in a format to comply with the LCLS interface.}. The LCLS control system automatically corrects for different TECx by internally correcting the delay to a reference time $t_{\text{REF}}$ that corresponds to EC 140, which occurs on 120 Hz, when the beam is present. The reference time is set to $t_{\text{REF}}=100000$ ns and thus we can write down the following equation for the delay time of the trigger for a sample jet at LCLS to coincide with the beam.
\begin{equation}
t_{\text{delay}} = t_{\text{AMO}} - t_{\text{REF}} - t_{\text{gas flight time}},
\label{eqn:sample-jet-delay-time}
\end{equation}
with $t_{\text{delay}}$ being the delay value for the LCLS EVR control system and $t_{\text{gas flight time}}$ the flight time of the sample from the gas source to the interaction region (IR). As described in \citep{Miller-1988-Oxford}, the terminal velocity $v_{\infty}$ of a sample from a supersonic jet is
\begin{equation}
 v_{\infty} \approx \sqrt{\frac{2 R T_{0}}{m} \left(\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}\right)},
\label{eqn:terminal-velocity}
\end{equation}
with the universal gas constant R, the temperature in the stagnation chamber $T_{0}$ and the ratio of specific heats $\gamma = \frac{c_{P}}{c_{V}}$, which is $\gamma = \frac{5}{3}$ for monoatomic gases such as rare-gases. The flight time of a certain gas can then be calculated by measuring the distance, $D$, between the source and the interaction region, thus $t_{\text{gas flight time}}=\frac{D}{v_{\infty}}$. The approach may be extended to approximate flight times of molecules, e.g., using the mass of CO, $m_{\text{CO}}=28$ amu, and also to gas mixtures, for example the mass of a $2\%$ xenon-131 and $98\%$ helium-4 gas mixture can be estimated using a weighted average according to their relative contributions, thus  $m_{\text{HeXe}} = 6.54$ amu.\\[1\baselineskip]

	\caption[Event receiver time delay at LCLS for supersonic gas jets.]{$t_{\text{delay}}$ as a function of the gas source distance to the interaction region. Xenon and argon has been used as sample gas in an Even-Lavie pulsed valve. The calculated delay values (solid lines) agree well with the measured delay times (dashed lines) to overlap the onset of the pulsed jet with the laser.}
	\label{fig:LCLS-delay-data}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:LCLS-delay-data} shows measured and calculated flight times using an Even-Lavie (EL) supersonic gas source\footnote{The EL-valve has the serial no.: EL 5 HRR NO 114.} instead of the earlier described Parker valve. The Evan-Lavie source has a very well-defined opening time of \SI{22}{\micro\second} and thus a well-defined gas jet, which can be time consuming to trigger properly without knowing $t_{\text{delay}}$. The data show very good overlap of the calculated delay times $t_{\text{delay}}$ and ion yield maximum of the particle beam. The calculated flight times include an error margin, which can also be read as a recommended scan range. While the electric triggering and actual valve opening times may add errors on the microsecond time-scale, uncertainties in temperature and distance from nozzle to IR change delay times drastically. For completeness, the terminal velocity of argon is $v_{\infty,\text{argon}}=512~\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$ and of xenon is $v_{\infty,\text{xenon}}=305~\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$ at room temperature.\\[1\baselineskip]
%
Very long flight times can occur when heavy gases, such as xenon, are used or long distances, $D$, are necessary. If the flight times $t_{\text{gas flight time}} > t_{\text{AMO}} - t_{\text{TREF}}$ the system has to be delayed onto the next event as negative delays are not possible in the LCLS timing scheme and Equation \eqref{eqn:sample-jet-delay-time} can be rewritten to
\begin{equation}
t_{\text{delay}} = \frac{1}{f_{\text{rr}}}+ t_{\text{AMO}} - t_{\text{REF}} - t_{\text{gas flight time}},
\label{eqn:sample-jet-delay-time-next}
\end{equation}
with $f_{\text{rr}}$ being the repetition rate of the event code.

\section{Time-of-flight mass-spectrometer}\label{sec:TOF-spectrometer}
%%%%%%%%%%%%
%- fundamental aspects to the TOF detector\\
%- I'm hoping on some specific drawings from Timur / LCLS and SIMION simulations from Timur here.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
An ion time-of-flight spectrometer was used in the interaction region to detect xenon and helium ions. A time-of-flight spectrometer uses electric fields to accelerate ions from the interaction region towards a detector. The detector unit often consists of a micro-channel plate (MCP) that allows a position sensitive detection of the particle signal. In the first stage, the ions are accelerated from the IR towards the detector. Here, the electric potential energy is converted into kinetic energy
\begin{align}
q U &= \frac{1}{2}m \left(\frac{d_{1}}{t_{1}}\right)^{2},\\
t_{1} &= \sqrt{\frac{m}{2qU}}\cdot d_{1},
\end{align}
with $q$ being the elementary charge of the ion, $U$ the voltage difference, $d_{1}$ the distance between the IR and spectrometer, $m$ is the mass of the ion, and $t_{1}$ is the time-of-flight in the acceleration stage. The ions then travel through a drift tube of length $d_{2}$ that is field free. As the velocity remains constant, we can write down
\begin{equation}
t_{2} = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2qU}}\cdot d_{2},
\end{equation}
with $t_{2}$ being the time-of-flight in the drift tube. The total flight time can then be written as
\begin{align}
t_{\text{time-of-flight}}&=t_{1}+t_{2}=\sqrt{\frac{m}{2 q U}} \left(d_{1}+d_{2}\right), \quad \text{and explicitly}\\
t_{\text{time-of-flight}} &\propto \sqrt{\frac{m}{q}}.
\end{align}
Typical for an experiment, all values aside from $m$ and $q$ can be considered constant. As the spectrometer is a cylindrical system, the time-of-flight denotes the final position on the detector and vice versa. Therefore, the position sensitive MCP yields insight into the $t_{\text{time-of-flight}} \propto\sqrt{\frac{m}{q}}$ of the ensemble of ions in the IR upon interaction with an X-ray pulse. Usually, ions start with a kinetic energy $E_{kin}\neq 0$, such that the flight times are altered. This results in a distribution of the ion signal instead of a strict peak structure. Atomic ion time-of-flight data typically exhibits a distinct peak structure while the signal from clusters is strongly broadened due to kinetic energy release from collective effects. Using this information, element specific data including insight in the ionization cascades can be gained \citep{Ho-2014-PRL}.\\[1\baselineskip]

\label{fig:spectrometer-detail}
\end{figure}
The configuration of the here used time-of-flight spectrometer is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:spectrometer-detail}. It consists of an electron and a, longer, ion side. With $\pm 5$ keV power supplies, ions can be detected up to kinetic energies of 50 eV with a time-of-flight resolution of 100 ps \citep{Ferguson-2015-JSR}. If only the ion side is used, ions with kinetic energies of up to 100 eV can be detected. The use of $\pm 10$ keV power supplies allows a detection of kinetic energies up to 150 eV. Electrons can be measured up to kinetic energies of 150 eV using $\pm 5$ keV power supplies, 300 eV if only the electron side is used and 400 eV when using $\pm 10$ keV power supplies. Ions and electrons can be detected whether they are emitted in any direction, in other words the spectrometer has a $4\pi$ solid angle collection \citep{Osipov-2013-PC}.

A side view of the spectrometer can be found in Figure \ref{fig:simion}. Ion, electron and photon trajectories upon interaction with a LCLS pulse have been simulated using SIMION. A conical lens stack avoids casting a shadow on the pnCCD detectors (top of image). The applied voltages in the experiment can be found in Table \ref{tab:tof-volategs}. Here, the electron side is powered to have unperturbed electric fields across the interaction region.
